# Neural_style_transfer
This notebook demonstrates neural style transfer using TensorFlow. The code in this notebook allows you to generate a stylized image by combining the style of one image with the content of another.

Setup
Dependencies
Before running the notebook, you need to install the following dependencies:

Python (3.x recommended)
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
IPython
tqdm
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow ipython tqdm
Running the Notebook
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb notebook.

Run the cells in the notebook one by one.

Provide the file paths for the content and style images.

Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

Execute the cell that calls the run_style_transfer function.

View the generated stylized image and the training progress.

Customization
Feel free to experiment with different content and style images, adjust the number of training epochs, and modify the hyperparameters in the run_style_transfer function for your specific use case.

Make sure to replace "your-username" and "your-repository" with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively. Additionally, customize the instructions based on your notebook's structure and the specific dependencies used in your code.
