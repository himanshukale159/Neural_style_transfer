# Neural Style Transfer Project

Neural Style Transfer Project

This project demonstrates neural style transfer using TensorFlow. The code allows you to generate a stylized image by combining the style of one image with the content of another.

## Setup

### Dependencies

Before running the notebook, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- IPython
- tqdm

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow ipython tqdm
```
## Running Notebook

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Neural_style_transfer.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd Neural_style_transfer
```
### 3. Open the Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb notebook.

### 4. Run the cells in the notebook one by one.

### 5. Provide the file paths for the content and style images.

### 6.Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

### 7. Execute the cell that calls the run_style_transfer function.

### 8. View the generated stylized image and the training progress.
